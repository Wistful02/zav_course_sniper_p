Change the values in the text file (/settings/coursenumbers.txt) to the classes you are trying to snipe.

Try to not change anything else tho.

do 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in this directory(folder) before you try to run this program.
Should have everything, I think.

Very new to this, so would have a lot of bugs.
